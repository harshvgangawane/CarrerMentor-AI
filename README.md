# Customer Churn Prediction System

## Problem Statement
Choosing the right career path is a critical decision for students and professionals, but it is often overwhelming.
Many individuals struggle to:

1]Understand which careers match their unique skills and educational background.

2]Identify the learning paths, courses, and projects that will prepare them for those careers.

3]Access personalized guidance without spending thousands on career counseling.

4]The lack of personalized, accessible, and AI-driven guidance results in confusion, wasted time, and missed opportunities.

## Solution Proposed
CareerMentor AI is an AI-powered career guidance platform designed to solve this problem by:

1]Analyzing user profiles (skills, education, interests).

2]Recommending top career matches with match percentages and descriptions.

3]Providing learning pathways — courses, projects, and roadmaps to help users upskill.

4]Accessible via the web (Flask app deployed on cloud platforms like Render or AWS).

5]Built with Python, Flask, and AI models for recommendations — ensuring fast, intelligent, and user-friendly interaction.
